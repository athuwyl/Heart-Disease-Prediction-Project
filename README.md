# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
Heart disease, or cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a leading global health concern, responsible for a substantial number of deaths worldwide. In 2019, approximately 17.9 million deaths were attributed to cardiovascular diseases, accounting for about 32% of total global deaths (WHO, 2021).

Key risk factors contributing to heart disease include an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Early detection and intervention are critical for effective management. Diagnosis involves medical history, physical examination, and tests.

The data provided is from different ages and sexes from Cleveland, Ohio. The dataset contains 14 variables to determine the presence of heart disease. There were 303 participants within the study and dataset.
